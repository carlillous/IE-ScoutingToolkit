# IE ScoutingToolkit (WIP)

This repository contains the code for a Scouting Toolkit based on Inazuma Eleven NDS games. This includes:
- Inazuma Eleven 1 (DS) **_(Not implemented yet)_**
- Inazuma Eleven 2: Firestorm / Blizzard (DS)
- Inazuma Eleven 3: Lightning Bolt / Bomb Blast / The Ogre (DS) **_(Not Implemented yet)_**

The main purpose of the project is to provide a tool to look after the players stats and skills in the game, helping the user to choose the best players for his/her team 
based on his personal preferences or desired playstyle.

All the data credits goes to  
http://watashiwa7.altervista.org/  
which is the webpage where the stats are published.
